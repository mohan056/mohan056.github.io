I am a current graduate student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities majoring in computer science. I finished my underraduate education in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the Univesrity of Minnesota as well. For a year, I worked as a data analyst at Allina Health where I streamlined clinical research by automating tasks and executing efficient data queries. I also worked as a junior software developer at Open Access Technology International where I used deep learning regression methodologies to predict electricity consumption for key locations. 
During my undergaduate years, I became drawn to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. One of my physics professors during my first year at the U said "The world was expecting a revolution in power but it got a revolution in data" which heavily resonated with me. I really do believe that the world is headed towards a place where pretty much all tasks will be data-driven. 

My primary interests lie in the area of Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare and Deep Learning. More than just the application of algorithms, I have always strived to understand the underlying math that drives such models. This has pushed me to pursue knowlede in the field of statistics and linear algebra. I have a thorough and emperical understanding of various state-of-the-art models.

This blog highlights some of my projects and research work.
